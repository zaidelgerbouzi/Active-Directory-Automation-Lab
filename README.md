# 📂 Automated Active Directory Environment & Network Troubleshooting

**Goal:** Deploy a Windows Server domain controller to manage users and security groups at scale.
**Skills:** Active Directory (AD DS), DNS/DHCP configuration, PowerShell Automation, and Layer 7 Troubleshooting.
**Key Achievement:** Successfully automated the creation of 1,000 user accounts via PowerShell and resolved critical DNS/Connectivity hurdles to join a Windows 10 client to the domain.

#### 🛠️ Real-World Troubleshooting (The Challenges)
In this lab, I encountered and resolved several complex issues that simulated high-pressure helpdesk escalations:
* **DNS Resolution & SRV Records:** Diagnosed a "Domain Not Found" error. I identified that while a Hosts file allows a "ping," it lacks the SRV records required for Active Directory. I resolved this by correctly configuring the Client's DNS to point to the Server IP.
* **Network Isolation:** Resolved connectivity "blackouts" by matching VirtualBox Internal Network names and disabling conflicting NAT adapters to ensure a clean path to the Domain Controller.
* **Kerberos Authentication:** Fixed domain join failures by performing a manual time-sync between the Client and Server, ensuring the system clocks were within the required security window.

**D. Connectivity & Domain Join Verification**
*Verifying end-to-end connectivity via ICMP ping and confirming successful domain authentication with the `whoami` command.*
